Garmin Connect IQ Game TriPeaks

Tri Peaks!  A fun card game you can play anywhere, on the go!  And best of all, it's completely free!

The object of the game is to clear the board by tapping cards that are one higher or lower in value than the last.  When you can't clear any cards, draw a new one to keep going.  Can you clear the board before you run out of cards in your deck?

Before starting a new game, you can set your theme, background color, and select the layout to play.  There are lots of layouts to choose from, including a heart, a Tie Fighter, an eyeball, and the original three peaks that give the game its name.  Or you can select to have the cards randomly placed, or even dumped in a pile in the center of the board!

You can change the theme, suit colors, background colors, deck position, and the animation speed, or view game statistics, from the settings menu at any time.

I made this game for fun and share it freely.  Find my other Garmin apps, or leave me a tip, at this link:
